# Robit Event Bus
Robit Event Bus is a simple channel driven event bus for golang projects.

## Motivation
Event buses are a powerful way of allowing different packages to communicate. At Robit we wanted something simple that required very little boilerplatee code to integrate in projects.


## Installation
All you need to get started is a golang project and then you can simply install with
`go get -u github.com/robit-dev/events`

## Tests
Tests can be run with `go test ./...`

## How to use?

```golang
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"time"

	"github.com/robit-dev/events"
)

func testSubscriber(topic string, data interface{}) {
	// Event contains the TestEventData as well as the topic the event was published on
	fmt.Println(topic)         // "TEST_EVENT"
	fmt.Println(data.(string)) // "Test event data"
}

func main() {
	// Create a new event bus with the context
	eb := events.NewEventBus(context.TODO())

	// Create a subscriber that can be used to subscribe to an event (or multiple events)
	subscriber := eb.CreateSubscriber(testSubscriber)

	// Subscribe to test event
	eb.Subscribe("TEST_EVENT", subscriber)

	// Publish an event (an event can be anything)
	eb.Publish("TEST_EVENT", "Test event data")

	// Sleep to see the output
	time.Sleep(time.Second * 1)
}
```
